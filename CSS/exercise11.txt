### Exercise: Styling a Feature Section

Create a feature section for a webpage that highlights a special offer, product, or service. Use background properties to make the section stand out.

### Task Objectives:

1. **Feature Section Creation**: Use a `<div>` element to represent the feature section.
2. **Background Color**: Choose a background color that complements the overall design of the webpage and apply it to the section.
3. **Background Image**: Add a relevant image as the background. This could represent the offer, product, or service being featured.
4. **Text Over Image**: Include a headline and a short description within the feature section. Ensure the text is legible over the background image.
5. **Image Positioning and Sizing**: Adjust the background image to cover the entire section without repeating, and position it to best fit the content.
