Exercise: Styling a Quote
Create a simple HTML page and style a quote using the font properties you've learned. The quote should have a different font family and size for the quote itself and the author's name. Make the quote italic and the author's name bold.



HTML Structure:
<blockquote>
    "The only way to do great work is to love what you do."
    <footer>â€” Steve Jobs</footer>
</blockquote>
