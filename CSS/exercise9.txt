### Exercise: "Stylish Content Sections"

### Objective:

Use CSS to style predefined HTML sections representing different interests such as books, movies, and foods. Each section should be distinctly styled using the CSS `width`, `height`, and other relevant properties.

### Overview:

You will be provided with a basic HTML structure. Your task is to apply CSS to style the sections according to the specified requirements. This will include setting dimensions and adding aesthetic enhancements to create a visually appealing layout.

### HTML Provided:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>Interests Page</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
</head>
<body>
    <div class="interest-section" id="books">
        <h1>Books</h1>
        <p>List your favorite books here!</p>
    </div>
    <div class="interest-section" id="movies">
        <h1>Movies</h1>
        <p>List your favorite movies here!</p>
    </div>
    <div class="interest-section" id="foods">
        <h1>Foods</h1>
        <p>List your favorite foods here!</p>
    </div>
</body>
</html>

### CSS Tasks:

1. **General Section Styling**:
    - Set the `width` of each section to `80vw`.
    - Set the `height` of each section to `50vh`.
    - Apply a `margin` of `5vh` to the top and bottom of each section to separate them visually.
    - Add `padding` of `20px` inside each section to ensure the content does not touch the edges.
2. **Specific Section Requirements**:
    - **Books Section**: Background color should be light blue.
    - **Movies Section**: Background color should be light grey.
    - **Foods Section**: Background color should be light green.
3. **Text Styling**:
    - Center all headings (`h1`) and paragraphs (`p`) within each section.
    - Set the font size of `h1` to `24px` and `p` to `16px`.
